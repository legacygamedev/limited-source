'                --- INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO TURN SAFE MODE OFF ---
'
'  INTRO:
'  Safe Mode is meant to prevent your server from getting knocked down.
'  It fixes all parse subscript out of range errors.
'  It is recommended to be kept OFF, but you should turn it on when testing.
'  If you believe a person may be trying to hack, turn it on!
'  A person may knock down your server by sending invalid packet data.
'  This prevents that and the server going down because of stupid coding errors.
'  A person has other methods to knock a server down, but this is the easiest way.
'  INSTRUCTIONS:
'  Search this module for all occurences of "SAFE MODE"
'  Follow the instructions!
